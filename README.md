# 100 Days of Coding Camp in Python

Welcome to my 100 days of coding camp journey in Python! My name is Dhanush K, an 18-year-old enthusiast who embarked on this coding adventure inspired by Angela Yu's Udemy course. I am thrilled to share my progress and learning experiences with you through this repository.

## About the Project

This repository documents my daily coding exercises, projects, and reflections as I delve deeper into the world of Python programming. Each day, I commit to spending time coding, whether it's solving problems, working on mini-projects, or exploring new concepts.

## Motivation

My motivation behind this 100-day coding camp is to strengthen my Python skills, enhance problem-solving abilities, and cultivate a consistent coding habit. By dedicating time each day to practice coding, I aim to build a solid foundation in Python programming and advance towards my goal of becoming a proficient developer.

## Repository Structure

- **/dayX**: Each day of the coding camp is organized into separate folders named 'dayX', where 'X' represents the day number. Inside each folder, you'll find the code files, project implementations, and any accompanying documentation or reflections.
- **/projects**: This directory contains larger projects or milestones achieved during the coding camp. Here, you can explore the applications I've built and the skills I've developed throughout the journey.
- **/resources**: Any additional resources, tutorials, or reference materials that have been helpful during the coding camp are stored here for easy access.
